It got to the point where I had to go see a doctor, and the doctor diagnosed me with ADHD.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Have you guys heard of Notehall? I created a service where students can buy and sell class notes and study guides.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Notehall is a win-win for both students because students who take great notes can upload them and earn supplemental income for it, and students that happen to fall behind for any variety of reasons can now log on to Notehall and get caught up instantly.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Given the competitive nature of the Internet, we have to move fast. We need the expertise and financial backing of the sharks to take this worldwide and literally help all future generations.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Hello. My name is D.J. Stephan. This is Sean Conway. Our company is Notehall.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"And we\\'re here asking for $90,000 in exchange for 10% of our company.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Notehall\\'s a website that allows college students to buy and sell class notes and study guides in each of their college courses.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"So, Kevin, let\\'s say you have a huge exam coming up.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"So you\\'re naturally gonna create a study guide to prepare for that exam. You\\'re gonna load it on Notehall.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"At the same time, Robert, you have been distracted by the cute blonde girl in class.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Absolutely not. I\\'ve been married for 20 years. That would never happen.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"But he has been stealing my notes for years.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"But you\\'re gonna go on and download Kevin\\'s notes and pay a few dollars doing this, and then Kevin\\'s gonna earn a commission on his transaction. It\\'s that simple.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We launched it at the University of Arizona, and within eight months, our website was being used by over 40% of the students on campus.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Wow.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We pilot launched at Arizona State University and Kansas University, and we saw relatively great traffic with basically zero advertising costs.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We\\'re planning on launching at 24 universities this upcoming fall, and with your help, we feel we can go nationwide in just a short period of time, making Notehall the next dorm room name on the web today.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Is it legal?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Yes, it is. Absolutely. What we\\'re doing is pretty much giving the students a better understanding of the actual course, and we\\'re teaching those students how to take notes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"How do you know the notes are good? Do you get a chance to take a little peek?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Of course. And review it before you sign up?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Right, so there\\'s actually a preview that\\'s automatically generated, and it shows 30% of the notes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"What if it\\'s the wrong information?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We offer a 100% money-back guarantee if students aren\\'t satisfied with the content they buy.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s better.

I actually come from a family that\\'s got a huge background in the fashion industry. My father, Al Beres, designed belts for 35 years. He sold to the high-end stores and celebrities—expensive, $1,000 belts.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"So basically, what I did when launching Washed Up Hollywood, I worked under his wing for 15 years, going to the trade shows, learning the business.

If you wanted 25%, I\\'d give you $100,000, $200,000. But I can\\'t give you $500,000 because I\\'d have to own you and every belt buckle that you\\'ve ever made. And all the ones you\\'re going to make for the next four years.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"How frustrating you are. You\\'ve got a real business, but you\\'re a pig. You\\'re greedy.

I created a service where students can buy and sell class notes and study guides.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Notehall is a win-win for both students because students who take great notes can upload them and earn supplemental income for it, and students that happen to fall behind for any variety of reasons can now log on to Notehall and get caught up instantly.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Given the competitive nature of the Internet, we have to move fast. We need the expertise and financial backing of the sharks to take this worldwide and literally help all future generations.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Hello. My name is D.J. Stephan. This is Sean Conway. Our company is Notehall.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"And we\\'re here asking for $90,000 in exchange for 10% of our company.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Notehall\\'s a website that allows college students to buy and sell class notes and study guides in each of their college courses.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"So, Kevin, let\\'s say you have a huge exam coming up.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"So you\\'re naturally gonna create a study guide to prepare for that exam. You\\'re gonna load it on Notehall.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"At the same time, Robert, you have been distracted by the cute blonde girl in class.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Absolutely not.

It\\'s that simple.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We launched it at the University of Arizona, and within eight months, our website was being used by over 40% of the students on campus.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Wow.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We pilot launched at Arizona State University and Kansas University, and we saw relatively great traffic with basically zero advertising costs.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We\\'re planning on launching at 24 universities this upcoming fall, and with your help, we feel we can go nationwide in just a short period of time, making Notehall the next dorm room name on the web today.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Is it legal?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Yes, it is. Absolutely. What we\\'re doing is pretty much giving the students a better understanding of the actual course, and we\\'re teaching those students how to take notes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"How do you know the notes are good? Do you get a chance to take a little peek?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Of course. And review it before you sign up?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Right, so there\\'s actually a preview that\\'s automatically generated, and it shows 30% of the notes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"What if it\\'s the wrong information?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We offer a 100% money-back guarantee if students aren\\'t satisfied with the content they buy.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s better. And we\\'ve only refunded about 25 out of over 5,700 documents that have been uploaded—but quick question—I just want to know how much you guys sold in one year?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Uh, so we had 5,900 credit card transactions in 8 months, and we had $30,000 in revenue.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"What\\'s the price of a typical note download?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"So the actual transaction price—our average transaction price—is around $4.90.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Do you get a cut off the fee I\\'m paying?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"So on average, Notehall will withhold, and then note takers will earn 40%.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"This is a great idea, and like other great ideas on the Internet, they get copied right away.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Right.

Why weren\\'t they able to get as many people?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"We\\'ve discovered a way to get content creators efficiently and effectively, and that\\'s the lifeblood.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Our competitors are just focused on trying to get as many users as they can, and no one\\'s uploading any valuable content.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"And if they don\\'t get the valuable content, students are not gonna continue and not gonna grow virally like we\\'ve seen so far at K.U. and A.S.U.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"What are you gonna use the money for?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"It\\'s all for customer acquisition.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"You\\'re gonna expand this into other colleges.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"Exactly.
