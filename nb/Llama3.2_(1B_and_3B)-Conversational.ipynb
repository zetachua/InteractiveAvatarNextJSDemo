Sharks, we all know how hard it can be to cook healthy, fresh meals while juggling our busy lives. How many millions of parents around the world care about the nutrition of their families but they hate cooking, don't know how to do it, don't have time to do it, or just plain suck at it? Well, what if all of that could change? What if cooking was so easy, you could literally walk into your home and talk to your kitchen?\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Nice. Sounds like science fiction?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Not anymore. Forget self-driving cars and start thinking self-cooking kitchens. Introducing Chefee, the world's first embedded robotic chef. From meal planning and cooking to tracking nutrition and, yes, even ordering the groceries, Chefee will do it all. Here's how easy it is to use. Just once a week, you'll restock ingredients, then open the Chefee app to place an order. Chefee will do the rest, weighing, combining, dispensing, and cooking. So, Sharks, who's ready to bring personal private chefs to everyone with Chefee?\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'You got to show us how it works.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'You got to show us how it works.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Yeah. Oh, of course. Let's do it. In front of you are three dishes that Chefee prepared. We have Spanish paella...\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Okay.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Spicy ratatouille, and tofu tikka masala.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'So Chefee made this?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Yes.

Yeah. It's my favorite.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Ta-da! Just like magic.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"What?! Chefee comes out of your counter, and the first thing it does, it picks up the lid of the cooker. It's gonna invert it.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'No way. It seems unbelievable.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'The future is here, Barbara. Wow. Chefee is made of two parts, upper and lower. The upper stores and dispenses ingredients.

What's it doing now?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"So right now it's dispensing and weighing. So it goes under. Yep. And based on what you put in the app...\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Exactly... it's going to put the materials in.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Correct. What about fresh things like proteins?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Right, so the left side is refrigerated. So we have a refrigeration module built specifically for Chefee.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"But you're not ordering from you.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"No, we're a robotics company. For the groceries, that's a subscription model. One of them is integration with Instacart or Amazon Fresh. You're in the robot business.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"That's what we do. We do the tech. So now it has the material. What's it doing now?\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Yep, it's gonna pour it right into the cooker.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Is that a standard cooker or yours?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Right. We don't reinvent the wheel. We're not here to build a cooker. We're here to build a robotic ecosystem that automates your appliances.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"So it's a vending machine connected to a bowl.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Far more than that, but, yes, if it looks that simple, then we've done a great job in hiding the complexity.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'It works with any stovetop?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"No, so these are cookers. They're inside of it.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Oh, so you provide that.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'But these are yours.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Correct. It's an induction cooker.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Okay. So it's all incorporated.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'All incorporated. You can install these in any modern kitchen on the planet.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'So what is this going to cost me if I say, \"I love Chefee. I saw it on \\'Shark Tank.\\' I want the whole thing, including installation and I hope a maintenance contract. There\\'s a lot of moving parts.\" What\\'s that going to cost me?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'For the value-engineered version of Chefee, as low as $9,500 is what we want to launch with.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"That's a big buy-in. That's 10 grand?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Yes. Everything I see here? The refrigeration will probably not be included in the 10 grand, because it goes from $9,500 all the way up to a premium version, which we want to...', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'How much is the premium version?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"We're thinking between $40,000 and $50,000.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Holy God, that's a lot.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Wow, so at $40,000 to $50,000, what do I get that I don't get at $10,000?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"So you would get more ingredients, right?

What does it cost to make one? What does it cost to acquire a customer? The numbers. That's what I want.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"First of all, we are pre-revenue. Okay, we haven't launched. We have a $500,000 signed LOI from a high-end kitchen remodeling company already in Palm Springs. Now, in terms of where we're going, we're going all in with social media and organic marketing. And we've also shown this already to builders, designers, high-end kitchen appliance companies like Wolf Sub-Zero. I presented this a year and a half ago face-to-face with one of their top execs. He loved it.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'The idea with someone like Sub-Zero is that they would rebrand this?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'That would be a licensing play.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Okay. Is that your go to market?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"It's not. It's not necessarily. So everything is on the table. That's the beauty. Let's talk about strategic partnerships with celebrity chefs, right, partnerships with builders, designers. We've been hosted by high-end designing locations in Austin, Texas.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"What do you mean you've been hosted? You've actually installed these units?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"So we installed three total, so one in our investor's home, one in our HQ, and now you're seeing this.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"So why haven't you shipped already?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Because I don't want to overpromise, under-deliver. I want to do the opposite. That's the sales pitch, right? Why specifically are you not shipping yet?\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Oh, we're not shipping, which is why we're here. We're raising $500,000 to get to manufacturing.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'How much have you raised so far?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '$450,000, and I injected...', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"For the $10,000 unit, what's your cost to make it?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'About $1,500 materials, $1,000 in labor.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"So let's just be clear here. You're not a robotics company. You're an integration company. You're taking off the shelf or stuff you've licensed, and maybe you've written some software and you have some IP and you're doing that to integrate it, right? You're not manufacturing the individual components yourself. Is that true?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"That's a great question. So, we are a robotics company. We have patents pending in the U.S. and abroad specifically for the entire system, the custom parts, and the embedded form factor. I spent a thousand hours on this. I've learned everything from mechanical engineering, under the 3-D printers in the office for weeks to get this done. So, yes, we're not producing the motors, but we're absolutely creating the entire robotic system.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"That's an integrator. There's nothing wrong with that.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Nothing wrong with that.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"No, I'm not saying there's anything wrong, but you got to say who you are and what you're doing and what's working, what's not working, because if we're going to understand how you get to a product, we have to understand why you're not already there. If you truly created something that is so differentiated, so unique, when you're in an industry when everybody and their brother, it seems like, is coming out with a new robotics space system, there should be so much money being thrown at you that you can't even keep up with it.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Well, but... Now I see you're trying to find the hole in my story, right? I see a thousand holes.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"I don't see any. I have a question to fill a hole. I want to buy the product. I want to put it in my Miami kitchen. Who's going to maintain it for me when it stops working?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Because it's such a simple, elegant system, we can actually piggyback on platforms like TaskRabbit.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Oh, you're killing me. All they need is plumbing experience. A handyman can install this.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Let me clear the deck. It sounds sexy, definitely. I was like, \"Whoa.\" You know, this is something I\\'d love, but I really don\\'t trust the execution. I\\'d be afraid to call and say mine is broken, so I\\'m out.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"You have the other Sharks. Assaf, regardless of what you've built or haven't built from an IP perspective, it's a beautifully designed, integrated machine. I'll give you that. Thank you. But if I don't want to cook, there are lots of other services where people can make well-prepared food packages that show up that don't cost $10,000. I just don't know if I see the market. I'm out.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Let me tell you guys a quick... Assaf, do you have one of these in your home?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Yeah, in our HQ.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'You use it every day?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Not every day, but we've used it a lot.

I want to hit the market with something that's beautiful, can make you hundreds of dishes from scratch. But yeah, I can't make you everything on the planet. But we can make a lot of potato dishes.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"You're like all inventors, right? You are so excited. You are so passionate. But I don't understand how well this will adopt. And maybe I'll be kicking myself down the road. But for today, I wish you good luck. But I'm out.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"I'm not worried about the price of this. I know the other Sharks are, but I know there's a high-end market for tricking out kitchens because I buy Sub-Zero products. That's why I was interested in hearing more about the Sub-Zero deal, because if they take it over, rebrand it, and provide their maintenance contract, that would be interesting. But I'm choking on the 4%. I mean, the next time you raise money, I get diluted.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"We're here, open to negotiation. Look, I'll make you an offer. I don't care if you like it or you don't.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Three Sharks are out, but Kevin is interested in Assaf's robotic chef company, Chefee.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Look, I'll make you an offer. I don't care if you like it or you don't. I'll give you the $500,000. I want 15%.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"Thank you for that offer. Yes. It's reasonable.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Assaf, I\\'ll simplify things. I think it looks great conceptually. Makes sense. Technically, not quite sure whose pieces and parts you integrated, but the reality is, there\\'s no way you did it from scratch and created everything in a couple of years for $450,000. The fact that you think it\\'s so crazy that we did this tells me that, \"Holy [bleep] yeah, we have done it.\"', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying you haven't said anything about the technology at all. You've described it and you've sold the value proposition, which is great. But I know a little bit about robotics. I know about, you know, operating systems and I know about integration. If you want, I can shut off sales and go technical and geek out with you from now until... for an hour.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Fire away.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Oh, please don't.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Are you going to do this deal or not?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"No. I'm out.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"So, I am the only chef up here.

Can I counter you with 8%?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'No.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"No. The journey is binary on this thing. I think the only way to actually make this work and sell hundreds of thousands of installations is with licensing. And you're gonna find that out without me or with me, because the maintenance is gonna be paramount.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Would you be willing to go down to 12%?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'No.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"Ooh, it's a tough Shark.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"I know. 12%, 15%, does it really make a difference?

I'm from a very small farm town of 500 people, Faith, South Dakota, and I grew up working on our family farm. Had to start operating machinery at a very young age. At the time I absolutely hated it, but looking back, I'm extremely grateful. I learned a lot of hard work, sacrifice, and that if you want something done, you've got to roll up your sleeves and do it yourself. And I do this full-time. I take care of the business on top of being a full-time stay-at-home mom.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** But I am a first-generation Latina raised here in the US by an immigrant single mother who came here for the American Dream.

I worked in credit cards, collections, I did personal loans, and I was even a car saleswoman.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Crowd:** [Wow.]', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** But I\\'ve always just had an entrepreneurial spirit and that hustler mentality. I did watch my mom also quit her three jobs and start her own cleaning company. So I began cleaning houses with her, knowing that I was gonna at least be in charge of my future. And then Sunny came along, and she just inspired such a beautiful and cool product, and I taught myself everything there is to know about business. If I, the daughter of an immigrant single mother with no college education, can go from cleaning houses, scrubbing toilets, to building a successful business and being on \"Shark Tank,\" they can do it too.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"**Crowd:** That's right.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** Wow.

I ran to my grandmother. She is a 65-year-old seamstress from Mexico, where she learned all of her amazing skills. And with $15, we built our first prototype.

How often do women talk about this and complain about it?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** So it's actually an unspoken pain point that I feel moms really don't talk about. When we had created the first prototype, I took it to the park. In my family, there's never a shortage of pregnant women. Someone's pregnant or someone's on their way to get pregnant.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Crowd:** [Laughter]', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** So I showed this to the moms, and I can just... It looked like they've seen a ghost. Like, their jaws dropped, and they're asking me if we can get them some. So it's a huge problem.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Shark:** To help just understand the demand a little bit and what kind of moms are wanting it, we opened up waitlist orders this last month...', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Shark:** And your customers are happy to wait?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** Happy to wait.

It's all social media-driven.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Shark:** What do you need the $100,000 for?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** Since we launched, we've consistently ran out of inventory. The demand that Jackie's been able to create through social media is far greater than our access to capital.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Shark:** How many people do you have waiting for an order?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** So we\\'re waiting on 600 units that are scheduled to arrive in the next couple of days, but I was being bombarded with e-mails and DMs, Instagram, TikTok of moms saying, \"Can I pay for this ahead of time? Because I want to make sure I get it before the next restock, so before it sells out.\" So that kind of just gave us a confidence to open up waitlist orders or preorders. And so we did that two weeks ago. And in one day, we did... We sold 482 units for a total of $29,000.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"**Cuban:** And what's your lead time for delivery?\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** I want to make you an offer just to shortcut it a little bit.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** There you go. I'll give you the $100,000 for 10%, exactly what you asked.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** What? Yeah. Why not? But let me tell you, numbers speak for itself and you are a charmer.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Cuban:** For 10%?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** Yeah, exactly what you came in asking for.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Cuban:** Would you also be able to fund purchase orders if and when we do decide to go into retail?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** I'm a good girl. No problem.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '**Cuban:** When you got an offer, you say yes.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** What's there to think about? No more talking.

Can I give her...\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': \"**Jackie:** Well, she's your favorite Shark now, that's for sure.\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"**Cuban:** Yeah, I'm my own favorite Shark. You are a lucky devil. You treat her well.\", 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '**Jackie:** I will. Thank you, Barbara.

Anything is possible if you're willing to work for it, no matter your background. Watching my mom work three jobs, I feel like she would just be really proud.

Meal time with kids is exhausting, especially when they're so little, they're still learning to keep their heads above their own necks. They hit their heads, they chew on tables, or they just create a disaster zone. And eating out with them? Forget about it. I would take my son to the restaurant, pull him up to the table, boom! He'd hit his mouth or he'd start gnawing on that germ-infested table edge because he's teething. That's why I invented The Table Tyke.

I\\'m not even a germophobe, and it grossed me out. So when I started talking to other friends, I\\'m like, \"Do your kids do this, too?\" And sure enough, it was, like, unanimous.

And I\\'m Kevin Atieh, CFO. And we\\'re from Madison, New Jersey. And together... Together: We\\'re the snack sibs! Sharks, we\\'re here today to ask for $300,000 for a 3.5% equity stake in our company... - Ooh. - Ooh! Like Air. America is a snacking nation. We love snacks. And if you\\'re anywhere from our snack is for you. So let\\'s say you\\'re craving a tasty snack, but you don\\'t want the guilt that comes with unhealthy options. That\\'s where Like Air Puffcorn comes in. It\\'s a delicious, light, and airy snack that melts in your mouth. And unlike popcorn, it contains no hard kernels, so it won\\'t get stuck in your teeth. Huh. There is nothing artificial in Like Air Puffcorn. It\\'s made with non-GMO corn. It\\'s gluten-free and free from eight major allergens. The best part? It\\'s only 50 calories per cup. You can have three whole cups per serving. While Like Air is light in calories, it\\'s not light when it comes to flavor. Like Air comes in four delicious varieties... Two savory versions, Classic and White Cheddar, and two sweet flavors, Pancake and Cinnamon Bun. And would you believe that Pancake and Cinnamon Bun have half the sugar as the leading kettle corn? We\\'ve created a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth snack that is better than popcorn. So, Sharks, who\\'s ready to take a bite out of the snacking market and help take Like Air to new heights? We get to try it? Yes, please. You have it right in front of yourselves. Oh, wow! This is so good. - Thank you. - Thank you. Wow! Classic is kind of our take on a movie-theater butter, but none of the junk. Do you grind the corn up into a paste and then use an extrusion system to puff it? Steve: Yeah, so it comes as a cornmeal. Ooh! And then it\\'s kind of mixed with a little bit of oil and water, just a little bit. And then it\\'s still very kind of powdery. And it goes right in the machine and puffs right out. This actually has a better flavor to me than movie popcorn. O\\'Leary: It\\'s very, very good. It\\'s probably the best low-cal snack... It\\'s incredible. We\\'ve seen on \"Shark Tank\" in 15 years. - Thank you. - Thank you. How did you come up with this? Lin: After having my first daughter, I got into what she was eating, healthy snacking. I saw a lot of areas for innovation in the snack market. So I came to my brother Steve, and I said, \"Let\\'s start a company together.\" So in looking at all the kids\\' snacks, we wanted something that we said, \"Okay, not just for kids, but for everyone.\" And puffcorn\\'s something that\\'s been around. There is a national brand, but it uses a lot of junk. So it has artificial color and artificial flavor and non-premium ingredients. So we basically took that and we put kind of that up-market spin on it. Mmm. I\\'m really proud of what\\'s in there. I\\'m, like, proud to give it to my kids. O\\'Leary: It tastes fantastic. Every flavor is fantastic. Thank you. Steve, what were you doing when Allison called you and asked you to start the business with her? I started my career off as an investment banker, and then went to work at a small pharmaceutical company as their CFO. And then we sold that company, and I was kind of doing some investments on my own and was ready to do something new. Said, let\\'s get him back to work. Yes. Yeah. And what were you doing, Allison? So I have a degree in international politics. I was a Fulbright Scholar. I studied conflict resolution... Greiner: What?! ...in Cyprus, worked at the United Nations... Wow! Something that\\'s a passion of mine. Amazing. And then, you know, I\\'d always wanted to do something kind of on my own. But I said, first, let me work at a startup. So I worked in financial technology. And then after having my first daughter, I started this company. Wow! What a r√©sum√©. What about you? I also started my career in investment banking. Then I worked in private equity, and since then I\\'ve worked in a couple high-growth startups. What\\'s the price? How does it compare to normal popcorn? It\\'s very similar in pricing to kind of all the bag snacks that are out there. How much is this? It retails about for $3.99. And wholesale? It\\'s $2.50 wholesale. What does it cost to make a bag? Costs 88 cents to make. So we actually just invested in our own dedicated production line at a new... Herjavec: Really? Co-packing partner in Chicago. - You bought the machine? - Ah, gotcha. Yeah, we bought the machinery. We spent a good amount on the machinery, about $2.5 million. O\\'Leary: Okay, let\\'s talk about... Okay, so you\\'ve raised a lot of money, then? We\\'ve raised about... Which explains what you asked for, right? What did you raise? So we raised... in 2019, we raised $800,000. We just raised $3.5 million more in our kind of growth round. And that\\'s at a $23.5 million post-money valuation. So I\\'m curious, if you just raised all this money, what do you need from a Shark? Lin: It\\'s a really competitive market. We need the partnership. What are your sales? [Laughs] What?! Did you make any money on that? We did... uh, we were break-even on that. Okay. What about... So 2022 we did over $5 million in sales. - Wow! - Make money on that? We did not make money on that. We lost 190K. - How is that possible? - So where did all the money go? Was it just new equipment or...? Okay, all right, so salaries, inventory distribution. We did 5.2 gross in 2022. And then trade spend was about 16% to get to net sales... - 16%? - Which was 4 1/2. So you\\'re paying to get on the shelf. It\\'s hard to do that because you\\'re competing in a really mature market... popcorn. Totally. So it\\'s, how do we stand apart, right? So it\\'s all about distribution. So right now we sell in Kroger, the number-one retailer in the country. We\\'re working with launching at all 2,200 Albertsons banners. So, guys, you left out 2023. The plan for... is to do over 10 this year. And so what do you think you\\'ll end up on a free cash-flow basis? You\\'re investment bankers. On that $10 million, what\\'s left over? So the plan for the year is to burn about $1 million in cash. Why can\\'t you... Okay, that says a lot about your... That doesn\\'t... Yeah. That\\'s the wrong answer. No, it\\'s not the wrong answer. I think so. It just says a lot about their goal. So if you\\'re spending this way and you\\'re willing to lose $1 million on $10 million, $12 million in sales, you must have very big ambitions. So what comes next? Yeah. So, we do have big ambitions. We really think we can grow this thing quickly. That\\'s kind of why we\\'re here. We need some help. It\\'s kind of a no-brainer to be here. But you don\\'t. Open doors. To open doors. Come on. You don\\'t need us to open doors on this. You\\'re at the point now where your sales speak for themselves because everybody sees all the reporting. And so anybody who would be able to sell this in volume at retail just looks at the reports and says, \"Oh, my goodness, Like Air is moving up the charts. We\\'re interested.\" So, I mean, is this just a commercial for you guys?',\n",

But with all their seed rounds, with all the following rounds that happened, I found my investment was shrinking up like crazy. They\\'re hoping to sell, as I am hoping they sell. But what I want to say is you\\'re gonna need a hell of a lot more money than you think you need. You\\'re gonna need millions of dollars to make it a home run.

We\\'re not looking to hit a single and... I hear you, Steve, but I think to Barbara\\'s point, you\\'re gonna need more money. It\\'s gonna be multiple rounds. By the way, I\\'m the tall, good-looking one, Robert. Mark\\'s on the other side. [Laughter] Thank you, Robert. Thank you. Well, listen, I\\'ll take a flier and give you an offer, okay? I will give you $300,000. I would go 7.5% if I\\'m non-dilutable. I don\\'t know if your other partners... That\\'s called a ratchet. You know these guys are bankers, right? Will go with that. I don\\'t know if they\\'ll go for this, but I\\'m... you know, listen, you want a Shark for a reason. You want a Shark because of their cachet and their connections.

Just for the sake of those that don\\'t understand it, that means whatever happens in whatever future rounds of financing you do, Lori never goes below 7.5% equity. And another term for it is called a ratchet because it really hurts, but it keeps her at... It doesn\\'t hurt if they see the value in your Shark. There\\'s another term for it... crazy. Ooh. We wouldn\\'t say that. Would you rather me not do that and want a higher percent? No. Uh, we\\'re open to talking about it and... Let\\'s counter. We\\'d love to counter. Yeah, we\\'d love to hear what you would... Okay. Well, why don\\'t you counter before I give you a different creative offer? I think we would propose... We would say that we don\\'t think we\\'re gonna need to raise again if we do... How about 10%? And dilutable? Dilutable? We would say... I think we would want... It might wind up in the same place, I don\\'t know. Would anybody else be interested in joining at that 10% for two Sharks? Kevin: We haven\\'t heard from Mark. For 10%, I would do it, yeah. We would do that deal. - Two vegan flavors. - Yeah. Well, Mark and I would do that deal for 10%. - You guys have a deal! - Okay!

Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Great presentation. - Hell yeah! - Yeah! Steve: 10%... we weren\\'t looking to do it, but it\\'s all about partnership.

We\\'re the wife-and-wife dynamic duo from Denver, Colorado, and we\\'re here seeking $150,000 for 8% in our company, Poplight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhen we first moved in together, we needed to install wall lights on both sides of our bed. Now, Sharks, we\\'re pretty handy, but installing wall lighting is a real hassle. Punching holes in your wall, running wires for electricity, patching drywall. Who has the time? We could hire an electrician to do it, but that could cost over $1,000. In this economy?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe thought there could be a better way to install wall lighting, and Sharks, that\\'s when we had our light-bulb moment. Let\\'s show them how it\\'s done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThis is Poplight. Poplight is modern, stylish wall lighting that\\'s as easy to install as it is to remove. Poplight installs in seconds. The base attaches to your wall using double-sided adhesive. No tools required. Plus, the Poplight base has a built-in level, so you\\'ll always stick the landing the first time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s cool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOh, good idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAll that\\'s left to do is swivel and click Poplight into place.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCuban: That\\'s cool. Wow. Wall lighting in seconds.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCorcoran: That\\'s it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nPlus, it\\'s dimmable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSorry. What was that, Lori? You want to know how Poplight\\'s powered? Great question. Poplight is USB-C rechargeable. Simply pop out the battery when you need to charge it, or leave it plugged in if you like the look. Options.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd we agree, Mr. Wonderful. Time is \"shmoney.\" It is not a very executive move to have to get up and adjust your wall lighting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why we created the Poplight app, where you can choose between three different color warmths, set a sleep timer, dim your Poplight, and control multiple at once.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhether you\\'re a first-time homeowner moving into an apartment, setting up a dorm room, or just want wall lighting that\\'s easy to install, Poplight is modern wall lighting designed for everyone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo, Sharks, who\\'s ready to revolutionize wall lighting with Poplight? Sharks, in front of you is your very own gorgeous Poplight for you to check out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSuper cool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat happens to the wall when you take off the adhesive?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNothing.

And you just have to tap it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nGot it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nGreiner: So that\\'s... it\\'s very...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHello, Maaaark. Great idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThis is a prototype, so we just did our first round of tooling. So you have our first tooling prototypes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOh, wow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDon\\'t drop it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s our baby. They did a nice job, though. The tooling looks good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s very clean, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: How much are you gonna sell it for?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo they retail for $95.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd what is it going to cost you to make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nFor one?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, for one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMm-hmm, yeah. So it costs $25 to make, about $30 landed, $95 retail, which puts our profit margin around 68%.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou\\'re gonna sell direct to consumer only?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s kinda expensive, guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSorry?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s kind of expensive, don\\'t you think?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe also ran a lot of tests. We found that people were more responsive if we priced it higher and offered a bigger discount.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI don\\'t think $95 is expensive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd offered a what?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOffered a bigger discount, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDiscount.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHow long does the charge last?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, it takes about four hours to get fully charged. And then the battery lasts between five and nine hours, depending on how bright it is. But you can leave it plugged in all the time using that cord.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo I\\'m curious... are there any others out there like this where it\\'s an adhesive back, besides the ones where you pop-on, pop-off?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou know what I\\'m talking about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, yeah. Tap lights. The under cabinet, like... tap lights.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, it actually didn\\'t exist. So, we needed it. We looked for it. We couldn\\'t find it. And we actually have a patent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo we have three patents on this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat do they cover?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe have a design patent. And then we have two pending patents on the technology behind Poplight. One is the way that Poplight swivels and clicks and the way it\\'s removable, the base from the wall light.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThe base to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSmart.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd then also the way the tape attaches to the base.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the part we wanted to protect because that means that if you were to put another stick-on wall light on the wall, you would rip off the paint.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: Have you sold any?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo we launched an incredibly successful Kickstarter at the beginning of this year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOoh, tell us more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe did over...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe did over $178,000 in a little under four weeks. Despite launching at 6:00 a.m., we met our goal at around 22 minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd then what we\\'re running into is inventory. We are slated to run out of our first run in about four months.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nTo meet the Kickstarter order?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMm-hmm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd have you shipped any of that yet?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNot yet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDo you have any orders outside of crowdfunding?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe launched a website.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nRose is the social media queen. This is Rose from Poplight. I\\'m kinda famous on TikTok, guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou are? What for?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nA little bit. We went viral on TikTok. We\\'ve actually gone viral several times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut all of our sales since our Kickstarter have been just through organic content.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nTell us the sales after Kickstarter online.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s not very exciting because we just got our website live.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut about $5,000.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'m guessing you both have other jobs still at this point?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe both still have full-time jobs, which is great because it helps us fund the... what we\\'re doing with Poplight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing wrong with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat do you guys do?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWell, tell us about you. What\\'s your background?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'ve been working in tech for several years, working in fast-paced startups.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI am a data whiz, and I think the most important thing I can tell you about myself is I\\'m the daughter of multiple generations of entrepreneurs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMy grandfather, most importantly, moved to America with not much except his skills and built an incredible life for himself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd I, like, really can say if he could see what I\\'m doing right now and who I\\'m talking to, the Manischewitz would be flowing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s just like, it\\'s such an honor to be here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCaroline: Yeah, it really is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMazel tov to your grandfather.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo I\\'m a licensed clinical social worker. I provide therapy to individuals and couples, and at the end of the day, Poplight or people, I just love figuring out how things work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAll right, guys, look, the whole deal is very nascent. It\\'s a total crapshoot, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut I\\'ll make you an offer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHold my hand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'ll give you the $150,000 for the 8%, but I want a royalty of $2 on it until I get back $500,000.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThen the royalty drops to $1 in perpetuity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe thought you\\'d throw in a royalty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOf course I would!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nShocking, right? Just shocking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s actually a really good deal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s not his worst deal ever, trust me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI think you guys are incredible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOr Kevin is getting softer in his old years because that is a really good offer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNo, it\\'s definitely us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'d like to give you a rather simple offer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCaroline: Uh-huh.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'ll give you the $150,000.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI don\\'t even want the stock, honest to God.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut I would like to get a $20 royalty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n$20?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut no equity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhoa!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAll Sharks are still in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCaroline and Rose have two offers on the table for their removable wall light, Poplight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nKevin has offered $150,000 for an 8% stake, plus a $2 royalty until $500,000 is paid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThen the royalty drops to $1 per unit sold.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBarbara has offered $150,000 for no equity but wants a $20 royalty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI don\\'t think they make enough money, Barb.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNo, I think you do make enough money at $20.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhen will that end?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd you keep your total stock.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhen does that end, Barbara?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNever ending.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s the best part.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNever, ever ending.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNever ending.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: I don\\'t know what\\'s happened here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBarbara and Kevin changed spots.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo you\\'re gonna be left with...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNothing, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt eats into some of our...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou can\\'t invest, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s a brutal offer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCaroline, Rose, you guys, I love the product.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou two are really impressive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI think you\\'ll figure it out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI think Kevin made you a pretty good offer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI would take his offer, I gotta tell you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nReally?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBarbara\\'s offer is absolutely nuts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI don\\'t know what she\\'s doing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing wrong with that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'m out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you for that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat are you doing, Lori?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI am not sure about your marketplace.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'m familiar with quite a few things that stick on the wall that light up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo I have a little bit of concern about your competition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nFor those reasons, it makes me hesitate, and I\\'m out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThere\\'s absolutely stick-on lighting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOne thing that keeps ours a little bit different from that is that the stick-on is hidden.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo most stick-on lighting, it either is showing underneath the light, so when you remove it, you have that access to the tab.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut then you see the plastic bits that are behind your light.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOr even worse, you can\\'t access the tape and you have to rip it off your wall and take off the paint.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s the win-or-lose to your business, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBecause if it\\'s transient, if I can just stick it and then pull it off and move it when I need to move it, and you\\'re the only one and that\\'s pretty protective, you win.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIf you\\'re not, you battle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut I\\'m just not convinced.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nRight?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo for those reasons, I\\'m out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo can I clarify it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThe question...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nO\\'Leary: Hey, these guys are out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nTime to focus on the deals now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBarbara, would you consider any less than $20?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOn the royalty?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat do you feel you can afford?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI think $12 would be more comfortable for us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDamn.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIf you\\'ll take $100,000 in cash and $50,000 in a credit line, I\\'ll do that deal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAll of a sudden, a really good offer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOkay, guys, you gotta make a decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOkay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nKevin, would you consider having that royalty go until you hit $350,000?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat would you consider?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat I gave... the offer I gave you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI think it\\'s very fair.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI like it a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThere\\'s absolutely no wiggle room there?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOkay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nUm, what do you think?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nKevin, we\\'d love to do that offer with you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat?!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAbsolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCongratulations, ladies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nLet\\'s have some fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you for your consideration and your patience, for real.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe\\'re so excited.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCongratulations, guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWell done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you, guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBye.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHave a good rest of your night.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBye.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDon\\'t you just love them?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, I do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThey\\'re great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI think I want to adopt them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThey\\'re

My name is Nathaniel Wellen. I\\'m from Los Angeles, California.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThis is my mom. This is my sister.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd I\\'m seeking $100,000 for 10% equity in my company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSharks, we\\'ve all been there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou get caught in the rain and you take out your umbrella, but you\\'re with someone of a different height.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s your tallest friend.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s your fast-walking, fast-talking business partner.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOr, ugh, maybe it\\'s your little sister.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNo matter how hard you try, the two of you can\\'t stay dry under that tiny brim.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThere isn\\'t even enough room for both your hands on the handle, so you struggle for control.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMaybe she pulls it down to her height and it smacks you in the head.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAah!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOr... and I\\'m sorry it had to happen like this, little sister...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut she walks too fast to stay under the umbrella.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nShe\\'s hit by a sudden torrential downpour! [Laughter]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>presenter<|end_header_id|> But she walks too fast to stay under the umbrella. She\\'s hit by a sudden torrential downpour! [Laughter] Sharks, either way, no one\\'s safe, no one\\'s dry, and no one\\'s happy. It\\'s been thousands of years, and the standard umbrellas we use today have not changed much. That\\'s why I invented The Duo, the dual-handle umbrella designed for two. Voil√†! The Duo conveniently adds a second hidden, adjustable handle so that two people of different heights can share the umbrella at the same time, walk in the rain, stay safe, they stay dry. And most importantly, they\\'re feeling right as rain. Because you know what, Sharks? Everyone deserves their own handle. The Duo comes with a so two people comfortably fit underneath it. We have our compact Duo that fits in any purse or bag, or our stick umbrella. It makes you look like a million bucks. Either way, we\\'ve got you covered, literally. Sharks, again, it\\'s been thousands of years, and the umbrella really hasn\\'t changed. Why don\\'t we make umbrellas the way they should have been created from the very beginning? Help me make it rain with The Duo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: Yeah! [Laughter] - Good, good. - Good job. You sound like a kid out of a 1985 movie or something. - Yeah. - Thank you. Tom Cruise in \"Risky Business.\" Okay, while my mom and sister go dry off, why don\\'t you take a look at the samples that I have in front of you. Oh, wow. That is a good size for a little... You know, the compact umbrella. Hey, how does the... Oh, you just pull it down. Yes. If you pull on the strap on the bottom... Now, where\\'s the second handle? It\\'ll come exactly down. So that umbrella... There you go. That\\'s a prototype. That\\'s not the final product. We\\'re getting ready to go to market. Oh, you\\'re a pre-revenue company. We are a pre-revenue company, but we\\'re getting ready to go to market. So three things constantly bring me to that million-dollar valuation. - Tell us. - Number one... We can\\'t wait to hear. Our IP, our patents. I don\\'t want to... We have one utility patent granted. - You do? Good for you. - Yes, we do. - That\\'s a big accomplishment. - But for what, Nathaniel? - For the idea of two handles. - Got it. Now, we have one other utility patent pending. That\\'s for the second handle, the locking mechanism inside it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNathaniel, how old are you? I\\'m 15 years old. - What?! - You\\'re 15? Thank you. So I made the prototype. I developed the design. I even applied for and received that first utility patent when I was 9. Greiner: Oh, my gosh! You\\'re so cute. That\\'s me and my dad when I was young, yep. Aww! And then I got invited to the Henry Ford Museum to compete in the National Invention Convention. - Wow. - Uh, yeah, where I won Most Original Invention... Good for you. In the country out of 144,000 participants. - Wow. Good for you. - Wow. That\\'s amazing. How did you get from your original idea to where it is today? Yeah, so that\\'s where our partner comes in, Shed Rain. They are the number-one U.S. market leader for everything umbrellas in volume and distribution and sales. You\\'re kidding. So you\\'ve already cut a deal with your manufacturer? Exactly. - Well! - Yes. They own... Tell us about that deal. Don\\'t talk to him anymore. They own 49% of the company. But they sell over 15 million umbrellas every single year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: Wow. - Now you\\'re talking. - That\\'s smart. And what was the deal you did with them for them to get 49%? For 49%, they\\'re gonna help us in the prototypes. They\\'re gonna help us in manufacturing, distribution. They\\'re gonna get us into places like Target, Walmart, Kroger, Costco. But they didn\\'t pay you for that 49%. They did not, no. We\\'re... So they have equity and you have equity. Exactly. And you\\'re going to share the profits and whatever comes into the company together. - Of course, yeah. - And how did they find you? Well, I made a cold call to Shed Rain. Thank you. Wow. On your own? Yes. You just picked up the phone and called them? Yeah. I e-mailed, called up, reached out to a bunch of companies. Shed Rain really stuck out. I formed a really good bond with their CEO, and their entire staff\\'s amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCan I go back to the product for a sec? Of course. So what do you think you\\'re gonna sell it for? There\\'s two separate SKUs. The estimated landed cost for the compact is $4. We\\'ll sell it wholesale for $10. We\\'ll sell it direct to consumer for $25. Wow. The stick umbrella we manufacture, estimated landed cost is gonna be $8. We\\'ll sell it for $20 wholesale, and direct to consumer is gonna be $50. Those aren\\'t bad margins. Thank you. Yeah. And who\\'s gonna do that, Nathaniel? Because you\\'re in school. I know you have this partner. It\\'s not clear what they\\'re gonna do, you\\'re gonna do. You\\'ll figure that out. Well, they\\'ll do all our distribution, and they\\'ll create all the umbrellas, so... They\\'re doing all your manufacturing. They\\'re doing all our manufacturing and they\\'ll pay for it too. And they\\'re fronting the money for the manufacturing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah. So that\\'s been clearly stated by them? I\\'m gonna go out on this because I don\\'t think you have a need for a Shark. You\\'ve got an ideal partner, Shed Rain. So I really don\\'t think you need the help of a Shark. I\\'m out. Thank you, Barbara. I\\'m very impressed with your presentation, but I have a basic rule. I have to be able to call my CEO 24 hours a day. I don\\'t like the fact you\\'re in school. What\\'s your teacher gonna say when I call your cell and you\\'re in school in the class? They\\'re not gonna let you answer, and that really pisses me off. So for that reason, I\\'m out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOkay. Cuban: Yeah, Nathaniel, along the same lines, a couple things. One... great example for kids out there that want to be entrepreneurs. I can\\'t tell you how many times I hear, \"Well, I\\'m too young, I\\'m too young, I\\'m too young.\" No, you picked up the phone. You called the CEO, created a connection, obviously met with them. You did that on your own. That\\'s a great example. Two... if you dilute your equity at all, even 10%, you\\'re under 50%. And that\\'s an issue going into what you\\'re doing. I know they get diluted the same amount, but given the circumstances, you want to stay over 50%. So for those reasons, I\\'m out, Nathaniel. But congratulations on what you\\'ve done. It\\'s amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you, Mark. Nathaniel, here\\'s kind of where I\\'m at. I think all the Sharks made really great points. Yes, you\\'re in school. Yes, you\\'re gonna get diluted. But you\\'ve built in a natural buyer. I love deals where there\\'s a potential exit already built in. You create this product, you partner with them, and it takes off, there\\'s no way they\\'re not gonna buy you out. Great point. So all you gotta do, man, is you gotta go out there and prove it works. You\\'ve got the distribution. You\\'ve got that money. I mean, I really like the deal. I\\'ll give you the $100,000 for 20%. You\\'ve done an amazing job. There are some nuances to it we can make better. And then I think you just gotta go market them, figure out the distribution. I can help you with all that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you, Robert. That\\'s my offer. And then you\\'d be getting in on the ground floor, too. [Laughter] Greiner: Nathaniel, let me tell you where I\\'m at... Thank you, Nathaniel. Because he\\'s given you an offer. So, first of all, you blow me away. You\\'ve done what so many people would die to do, which is you got a partner of the world\\'s largest manufacturer of your idea. I think you have the perfect partner. So for those reasons, I\\'m gonna take myself out. But Robert did give you an offer. $100,000 for 20%. I\\'m not making it to a 15-year-old kid. I\\'m making it to a real entrepreneur who\\'s done a lot of the legwork. What do you say?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCan I counter? - Yes. - Of course. Would you be open to 15% for $100,000? I\\'ll do it for 18%. You got a deal, Robert. Done! Ta-da! Congratulations. - Good deal. - Awesome. [Laughter] - Great job. - Thank you, Robert. - Congratulations. - Great job. Advice for other kid-preneurs is to just keep moving, keep going. Even if something doesn\\'t go your way, just keep going for it, reach for your goals, and maybe you\\'ll make a deal with Robert, something amazing like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nKaley: Our dad invented the Cup Board Pro, and it was his dream to pitch it on \"Shark Tank.\" Unfortunately, he passed away before he had that chance. Oh, I\\'m sorry. But we\\'re here today to continue his legacy and make that dream a reality. One of the most heartwarming pitches in \"Shark Tank\" history was Cup Board Pro. As he was getting his first prototypes, our mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. Cuban: Ohh. And he put everything on hold to be by her side. And we\\'re only able to be here because of how strong our parents were. Three lovely kids came out, and their father had just passed away. They had also lost their mother, and they touched all of our hearts so deeply. We decided to work together. Wow. And so all five Sharks are gonna come together...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n[Laughter] Which is a rarity. It\\'s a deal. - It\\'s a deal. - It\\'s a deal. All right. - Oh, yay. - Thank you so much. Greiner: We all went in together and gave them the deal, and they\\'re doing fabulous today. Bring it in. Bring it in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNext in the tank is a product that helps prevent meal-time accidents. Hi, Sharks. My name is Berlyn Haughton. I\\'m from Franklin, Tennessee, and I am seeking $100,000 for 10% of my company, The Table Tyke. Meal time with kids is exhausting, especially when they\\'re so little, they\\'re still learning to keep their heads above their own necks. They hit their heads, they chew on tables, or they just create a disaster zone. And eating out with them? Forget about it. I would take my son to the restaurant, pull him up to the table, boom! He\\'d hit his mouth or he\\'d start gnawing on that germ-infested table edge because he\\'s teething. That\\'s why I invented The Table Tyke. It\\'s the only multifunctional silicone placemat with a table-edge bumper. It\\'s the parenting hack you won\\'t regret buying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOur half-inch-tall bumper not only protects them from hitting their head and chewing on the table... [Laughter] but it also catches spills...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: Oh. Making cleanup so much easier for the parents. You can put the food right on our non-slip grip mat. Cuban: Clever. As soon as they\\'re done eating it, you can shake it off, roll it up, pull the loops over each end. Smart. The mess stays in the mat. As soon as you get home, you can unroll it and throw it in the dishwasher. The Table Tyke is great for snacks, meals, and activities, and it grows with your kids, from babies to toddlers to big kids, and now even adults. The Table Tyke XL is double the size for double the fun. That\\'s for really old guys? [Chuckles] For you. For the old guy. This is perfect for baking, crafting, potting. The uses are endless because sometimes us big kids like to make a mess, too. Sharks, don\\'t miss out on the opportunity to roll with us as we are keeping babies safe, kids entertained, and messes contained with The Table Tyke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n- Good job. Good job. - Thanks. Sharks, you have samples in front of you. Herjavec: Wow. Is a child hitting their head on the edge of the table a big deal? I actually have a friend whose baby knocked their tooth out. Ouch! Yes. The reason that I started The Table Tyke is because when we were eating out at restaurants, my younger son would always hit his mouth, or there\\'s just germs. I\\'m not even a germophobe, and it grossed me out. So when I started talking to other friends, I\\'m like, \"Do your kids do this, too?\" And sure enough, it was, like, unanimous. Everybody had this problem with their kids. This is when my idea started. I\\'m like, if I made this mat with a bumper, would people buy it? Across the board, people thought it was brilliant. Everybody that sees the mat says, \"That is genius. When are you going on \\'Shark Tank\\'?\" All the time. And here you are. And here I am!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nJust like that. Tell us about the sales. So we launched at the very end of 2020. $10,000 in sales. The next year, we did $24,000. That was 100% grassroots. I didn\\'t do nothing on social media. It was, like, really word of mouth. And then... And then my goal was to double in sales last year. I quadrupled in sales, did just under 100K, and this year projected to do 200K. Why do you think word of mouth hasn\\'t carried it further to generate more sales? Over 60% of my sales last year happened in Q4. So we hit our boom through that word of mouth because I started using TikTok.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n-Ah! -Ah! So once I had that social proof, people are seeing it, then all of a sudden people are buying it and they\\'re buying it again for their friends. So people love the product. I just need help getting it out there more. Berlyn, I have 5-year-old twins, as you may know. Yes, I know. I\\'ve lived this problem. Yeah. This is a great product. Thank you. I\\'ve done a lot of investments in this space. Yep. Here\\'s the challenge. Is this big enough to sustain a business, or is it a one-hit wonder? So I have that concern, too. This is a product that people love. And the good thing about The Table Tyke... A lot of the placemats that are out there are used for a very short period of time. My almost-8-year-old... We literally still use this mat. People are willing to spend 25 bucks on it because they\\'re gonna use it for years. But that\\'s not good if I buy it once and it stays with the child.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>investor<|end_header_id|> right age. And it ain\\'t easy. But I can\\'t add a lot of value here. I had my kids a long time ago. I remember them banging their heads and everything else. [Laughter] It was... I just don\\'t even want to go back there. Me either! So I like to invest in products that I actually use so I can push my... Give it five years, Kevin. Well, maybe the XL. That\\'s what I\\'m thinking. No, I appreciate that. I\\'m gonna need the XL. Look, I love it, but it\\'s not for me. - I understand. - I\\'m out. Well, thank you. You know, Berlyn, I\\'m kind of in the same boat, where I think you\\'ve done an amazing job, right, to go from where you started to being able to have a great product, putting it together yourself. Yep. You deserve a ton of credit. Thank you. But this is just not my wheelhouse. So for those reasons, I\\'m out. Yeah, I appreciate that. Greiner: Berlyn, you made a really nice product. There is competition out there, but in a sea of others, you came up with something unique. Mm-hmm. Sometimes it\\'s not good to bring in an investor. I think you just need to keep doing what you\\'re doing and make it a great living for you. I wish you good luck, but I\\'m out. Thank you. Well, I would love to have you as a partner. I don\\'t want to... Corcoran: Well, what we have here right now is a business that doesn\\'t have room for a Shark. I think you\\'ve been terrific in what you\\'ve produced here. I just think you are on the verge of really doing a lot of sales. And the answer is in social media. Yeah. This is a time and a place for TikTok and Insta, but there\\'s no room for a Shark, so I\\'m out. Yeah. Thank you. O\\'Leary: You still have one Shark left. Robert, what are you doing? Um, look, after 15 years, I want to invest in stuff that I think has a really big return. Yeah. I don\\'t see the vision beyond a million or two. And I want to invest in bigger stuff. Yeah, I understand. It\\'s just not for me right now. Okay. Fantastic design, but I\\'m out. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Congrats, Berlyn. Good luck. And I just really appreciate the advice, okay. - Thank you. - Thanks, everybody. - Thank you, Berlyn. - Thank you so much. I, of course, wanted a deal, but the Sharks were so complimentary. And, you know, they said a lot of great things about the product and that it is a good product. So getting the validity from them just makes me want to push even harder.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNext into the tank is a better-for-you version of a classic snack. Hi, Sharks. I\\'m Allison Lin, co-founder of Like Air. I\\'m Steve Atieh, co-founder. And I\\'m Kevin Atieh, CFO. And we\\'re from Madison, New Jersey. And together... Together: We\\'re the snack sibs! Sharks, we\\'re here today to ask for $300,000 for a 3.5% equity stake in our company... - Ooh. - Ooh! Like Air. America is a snacking nation. We love snacks. And if you\\'re anywhere from our snack is for you. So let\\'s say you\\'re craving a tasty snack, but you don\\'t want the guilt that comes with unhealthy options. That\\'s where Like Air Puffcorn comes in. It\\'s a delicious, light, and airy snack that melts in your mouth. And unlike popcorn, it contains no hard kernels, so it won\\'t get stuck in your teeth. Huh. There is nothing artificial in Like Air Puffcorn. It\\'s made with non-GMO corn. It\\'s gluten-free and free from eight major allergens. The best part? It\\'s only 50 calories per cup. You can have three whole cups per serving. While Like Air is light in calories, it\\'s not light when it comes to flavor. Like Air comes in four delicious varieties... Two savory versions, Classic and White Cheddar, and two sweet flavors, Pancake and Cinnamon Bun. And would you believe that Pancake and Cinnamon Bun have half the sugar as the leading kettle corn? We\\'ve created a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth snack that is better than popcorn. So, Sharks, who\\'s ready to take a bite out of the snacking market and help take Like Air to new heights? We get to try it? Yes, please. You have it right in front of yourselves. Oh, wow! This is so good. - Thank you. - Thank you. Wow! Classic is kind of our take on a movie-theater butter, but none of the junk. Do you grind the corn up into a paste and then use an extrusion system to puff it? Steve: Yeah, so it comes as a cornmeal. Ooh! And then it\\'s kind of mixed with a little bit of oil and water, just a little bit. And then it\\'s still very kind of powdery. And it goes right in the machine and puffs right out. This actually has a better flavor to me than movie popcorn. O\\'Leary: It\\'s very, very good. It\\'s probably the best low-cal snack... It\\'s incredible. We\\'ve seen on \"Shark Tank\" in 15 years. - Thank you. - Thank you. How did you come up with this? Lin: After having my first daughter, I got into what she was eating, healthy snacking. I saw a lot of areas for innovation in the snack market. So I came to my brother Steve, and I said, \"Let\\'s start a company together.\" So in looking at all the kids\\' snacks, we wanted something that we said, \"Okay, not just for kids, but for everyone.\" And puffcorn\\'s something that\\'s been around. There is a national brand, but it uses a lot of junk. So it has artificial color and artificial flavor and non-premium ingredients. So we basically took that and we put kind of that up-market spin on it. Mmm. I\\'m really proud of what\\'s in there. I\\'m, like, proud to give it to my kids. O\\'Leary: It tastes fantastic. Every flavor is fantastic. Thank you. Steve, what were you doing when Allison called you and asked you to start the business with her? I started my career off as an investment banker, and then went to work at a small pharmaceutical company as their CFO. And then we sold that company, and I was kind of doing some investments on my own and was ready to do something new. Said, let\\'s get him back to work. Yes. Yeah. And what were you doing, Allison? So I have a degree in international politics. I was a Fulbright Scholar. I studied conflict resolution... Greiner: What?! ...in Cyprus, worked at the United Nations... Wow! Something that\\'s a passion of mine. Amazing. And then, you know, I\\'d always wanted to do something kind of on my own. But I said, first, let me work at a startup. So I worked in financial technology. And then after having my first daughter, I started this company. Wow! What a r√©sum√©. What about you? I also started my career in investment banking. Then I worked in private equity, and since then I\\'ve worked in a couple high-growth startups. What\\'s the price? How does it compare to normal popcorn? It\\'s very similar in pricing to kind of all the bag snacks that are out there. How much is this? It retails about for $3.99. And wholesale? It\\'s $2.50 wholesale. What does it cost to make a bag? Costs 88 cents to make. So we actually just invested in our own dedicated production line at a new... Herjavec: Really? Co-packing partner in Chicago. - You bought the machine? - Ah, gotcha. Yeah, we bought the machinery. We spent a good amount on the machinery, about $2.5 million. O\\'Leary: Okay, let\\'s talk about... Okay, so you\\'ve raised a lot of money, then? We\\'ve raised about... Which explains what you asked for, right? What did you raise? So we raised... in 2019, we raised $800,000. We just raised $3.5 million more in our kind of growth round. And that\\'s at a $23.5 million post-money valuation. So I\\'m curious, if you just raised all this money, what do you need from a Shark? Lin: It\\'s a really competitive market. We need the partnership. What are your sales? [Laughs] What?! Did you make any money on that? We did... uh, we were break-even on that. Okay. What about... So 2022 we did over $5 million in sales. - Wow! - Make money on that? We did not make money on that. We lost 190K. - How is that possible? - So where did all the money go? Was it just new equipment or...? Okay, all right, so salaries, inventory distribution. We did 5.2 gross in 2022. And then trade spend was about 16% to get to net sales... - 16%? - Which was 4 1/2. So you\\'re paying to get on the shelf. It\\'s hard to do that because you\\'re competing in a really mature market... popcorn. Totally. So it\\'s, how do we stand apart, right? So it\\'s all about distribution. So right now we sell in Kroger, the number-one retailer in the country. We\\'re working with launching at all 2,200 Albertsons banners. So, guys, you left out 2023. The plan for... is to do over 10 this year. And so what do you think you\\'ll end up on a free cash-flow basis? You\\'re investment bankers. On that $10 million, what\\'s left over? So the plan for the year is to burn about $1 million in cash. Why can\\'t you... Okay, that says a lot about your... That doesn\\'t... Yeah. That\\'s the wrong answer. No, it\\'s not the wrong answer. I think so. It just says a lot about their goal. So if you\\'re spending this way and you\\'re willing to lose $1 million on $10 million, $12 million in sales, you must have very big ambitions. So what comes next? Yeah. So, we do have big ambitions. We really think we can grow this thing quickly. That\\'s kind of why we\\'re here. We need some help. It\\'s kind of a no-brainer to be here. But you don\\'t. Open doors. To open doors. Come on. You don\\'t need us to open doors on this. You\\'re at the point now where your sales speak for themselves because everybody sees all the reporting. And so anybody who would be able to sell this in volume at retail just looks at the reports and says, \"Oh, my goodness, Like Air is moving up the charts. We\\'re interested.\" So, I mean, is this just a commercial for you guys?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAll Sharks are still in, but Mark is suspicious about Kevin, Allison, and Steve\\'s real motivation for coming in the tank with their puffed-corn snack business, Like Air. Cuban: I mean, is this just a commercial for you guys? Here\\'s a good example. No. So at a big retailer like Kroger, we\\'ve only been on-shelf at Kroger in the last 15 months. We\\'ve never gotten off-shelf. Like, about 70% of salty snacks are sold on display and on promotion. So we need to get off-shelf. Steve, you talked about big ambitions. We heard the $10 million. What\\'s the big ambition? So we think we can do, in 2024, about $30 million and then kind of go from there... $50 million and then potentially $80 million the year after that. Guys, you\\'re very, very impressive. I mean, you definitely have the team to pull this off. The problem for me is 3.5%... I don\\'t get out of bed for 3.5%. I don\\'t even... I\\'ll do that deal and forget about it. This journey isn\\'t for me, guys. I\\'m out. - Okay. Thank you. - We appreciate it. Corcoran: Let me share with you a happy story that turned out not so happy in the end. Okay. Yeah. I invested in a company called Pipcorn when they had one snack. Now they have 68. Phenomenally successful by anyone\\'s standard. They have just passed $70 million in sales. Yeah. I only invested $100,000 in their business. I took 20%. Boy, was I happy. But with all their seed rounds, with all the following rounds that happened, I found my investment was shrinking up like crazy. They\\'re hoping to sell, as I am hoping they sell. But what I want to say is you\\'re gonna need a hell of a lot more money than you think you need. You\\'re gonna need millions of dollars to make it a home run. By the time you get there, you will have your investors watered down and you will be putting so much money in there. I don\\'t think I want to go on that long trip with you. Barbara... So I\\'ll be out. - Okay. Thank you. - We appreciate it. - Thank you, Barbara. - Thank you, Barbara. Herjavec: Guys, I can\\'t fault you for anything. I mean, incredible growth, incredible sales. It\\'s just not the reason I\\'m on \"Shark Tank.\" I\\'m on \"Shark Tank\" to add value where I can help with people. me. I wish you all the best. I\\'m out. And, Mark, we\\'d just like to say that we do think that this is a real return opportunity of many multiples, tens of times your money back. We\\'re looking for a home run. We\\'re not looking to hit a single and... I hear you, Steve, but I think to Barbara\\'s point, you\\'re gonna need more money. It\\'s gonna be multiple rounds. By the way, I\\'m the tall, good-looking one, Robert. Mark\\'s on the other side. [Laughter] Thank you, Robert. Thank you. Well, listen, I\\'ll take a flier and give you an offer, okay? I will give you $300,000. I would go 7.5% if I\\'m non-dilutable. I don\\'t know if your other partners... That\\'s called a ratchet. You know these guys are bankers, right? Will go with that. I don\\'t know if they\\'ll go for this, but I\\'m... you know, listen, you want a Shark for a reason. You want a Shark because of their cachet and their connections. And that means the Shark has to work for you in a different way than your other investors. I don\\'t have to explain what a non-dilutable... - Steve knows what this is. - Yeah, we\\'re well aware. Just for the sake of those that don\\'t understand it, that means whatever happens in whatever future rounds of financing you do, Lori never goes below 7.5% equity. And another term for it is called a ratchet because it really hurts, but it keeps her at... It doesn\\'t hurt if they see the value in your Shark. There\\'s another term for it... crazy. Ooh. We wouldn\\'t say that. Would you rather me not do that and want a higher percent? No. Uh, we\\'re open to talking about it and... Let\\'s counter. We\\'d love to counter. Yeah, we\\'d love to hear what you would... Okay. Well, why don\\'t you counter before I give you a different creative offer? I think we would propose... We would say that we don\\'t think we\\'re gonna need to raise again if we do... How about 10%? And dilutable? Dilutable? We would say... I think we would want... It might wind up in the same place, I don\\'t know. Would anybody else be interested in joining at that 10% for two Sharks? Kevin: We haven\\'t heard from Mark. For 10%, I would do it, yeah. We would do that deal. - Two vegan flavors. - Yeah. Well, Mark and I would do that deal for 10%. - You guys have a deal! - Okay! [Cheers and laughter] Corcoran: Nice job. - Appreciate you, man. - Thank you very much. - Congratulations. - Oh, thank you guys so much. We\\'re so excited. - You\\'re welcome. Yay! Thank you, guys. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Great presentation. - Hell yeah! - Yeah! Steve: 10%... we weren\\'t looking to do it, but it\\'s all about partnership. We\\'d rather have a smaller piece of the pie for the future because that\\'s what it\\'s all about. It\\'s a really competitive space, salty snacks. So having Mark and Lori on board with us will just help open doors.<|eot_id|>'"

When are you going on \\'Shark Tank\\'?\" All the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat? You\\'re gonna need a hell of a lot more money than you think you need. I mean, is this just a commercial for you guys or...?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah! [Laughter]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nFirst into the tank is an easy way to brighten your living space.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhere are they? [Chuckles] They changed their mind. [Rooster crows]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nGood morning, Sharks! I\\'m Caroline. And I\\'m Rose. We\\'re the wife-and-wife dynamic duo from Denver, Colorado, and we\\'re here seeking $150,000 for 8% in our company, Poplight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhen we first moved in together, we needed to install wall lights on both sides of our bed. Now, Sharks, we\\'re pretty handy, but installing wall lighting is a real hassle. Punching holes in your wall, running wires for electricity, patching drywall. Who has the time? We could hire an electrician to do it, but that could cost over $1,000. In this economy?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe thought there could be a better way to install wall lighting, and Sharks, that\\'s when we had our light-bulb moment. Let\\'s show them how it\\'s done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThis is Poplight. Poplight is modern, stylish wall lighting that\\'s as easy to install as it is to remove. Poplight installs in seconds. The base attaches to your wall using double-sided adhesive. No tools required. Plus, the Poplight base has a built-in level, so you\\'ll always stick the landing the first time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s cool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOh, good idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAll that\\'s left to do is swivel and click Poplight into place.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCuban: That\\'s cool. Wow. Wall lighting in seconds.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nCorcoran: That\\'s it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nPlus, it\\'s dimmable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSorry. What was that, Lori? You want to know how Poplight\\'s powered? Great question. Poplight is USB-C rechargeable. Simply pop out the battery when you need to charge it, or leave it plugged in if you like the look. Options.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd we agree, Mr. Wonderful. Time is \"shmoney.\" It is not a very executive move to have to get up and adjust your wall lighting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why we created the Poplight app, where you can choose between three different color warmths, set a sleep timer, dim your Poplight, and control multiple at once.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhether you\\'re a first-time homeowner moving into an apartment, setting up a dorm room, or just want wall lighting that\\'s easy to install, Poplight is modern wall lighting designed for everyone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo, Sharks, who\\'s ready to revolutionize wall lighting with Poplight? Sharks, in front of you is your very own gorgeous Poplight for you to check out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSuper cool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat happens to the wall when you take off the adhesive?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNothing. We designed Poplight so that when you remove the tape, you don\\'t leave any damage on your wall.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: Where\\'s the button to turn it on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIf you look at the bottom, you\\'ll see a little power... Robert! And you just have to tap it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nGot it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nGreiner: So that\\'s... it\\'s very...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHello, Maaaark. Great idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThis is a prototype, so we just did our first round of tooling. So you have our first tooling prototypes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOh, wow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDon\\'t drop it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s our baby. They did a nice job, though. The tooling looks good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s very clean, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: How much are you gonna sell it for?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo they retail for $95.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd what is it going to cost you to make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nFor one?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, for one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMm-hmm, yeah. So it costs $25 to make, about $30 landed, $95 retail, which puts our profit margin around 68%.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou\\'re gonna sell direct to consumer only?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s kinda expensive, guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSorry?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThat\\'s kind of expensive, don\\'t you think?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe also ran a lot of tests. We found that people were more responsive if we priced it higher and offered a bigger discount.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI don\\'t think $95 is expensive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd offered a what?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOffered a bigger discount, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDiscount.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHow long does the charge last?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, it takes about four hours to get fully charged. And then the battery lasts between five and nine hours, depending on how bright it is. But you can leave it plugged in all the time using that cord.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo I\\'m curious... are there any others out there like this where it\\'s an adhesive back, besides the ones where you pop-on, pop-off?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou know what I\\'m talking about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, yeah. Tap lights. The under cabinet, like... tap lights.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah, it actually didn\\'t exist. So, we needed it. We looked for it. We couldn\\'t find it. And we actually have a patent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo we have three patents on this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat do they cover?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe have a design patent. And then we have two pending patents on the technology behind Poplight. One is the way that Poplight swivels and clicks and the way it\\'s removable, the base from the wall light.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThe base to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSmart.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd then also the way the tape attaches to the base.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the part we wanted to protect because that means that if you were to put another stick-on wall light on the wall, you would rip off the paint.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHerjavec: Have you sold any?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nSo we launched an incredibly successful Kickstarter at the beginning of this year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nOoh, tell us more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe did over...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe did over $178,000 in a little under four weeks. Despite launching at 6:00 a.m., we met our goal at around 22 minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd then what we\\'re running into is inventory. We are slated to run out of our first run in about four months.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nTo meet the Kickstarter order?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nMm-hmm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAnd have you shipped any of that yet?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nNot yet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nDo you have any orders outside of crowdfunding?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe launched a website.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nRose is the social media queen. This is Rose from Poplight. I\\'m kinda famous on TikTok, guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou are? What for?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nA little bit. We went viral on TikTok. We\\'ve actually gone viral several times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut all of our sales since our Kickstarter have been just through organic content.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nTell us the sales after Kickstarter online.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nIt\\'s not very exciting because we just got our website live.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBut about $5,000.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'m guessing you both have other jobs still at this point?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWe both still have full-time jobs, which is great because it helps us fund the... what we\\'re doing with Poplight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing wrong with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat do you guys do?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWell, tell us about you. What\\'s your background?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nI\\'ve been working in tech for several years, working in fast-paced startups.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n'"
