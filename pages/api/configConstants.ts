      `so our company offers three bundling
      packages where we categorize
      the construction projects based on the
      amount of concrete used into small
      medium and large so with that with these
      different bundling packages we will then
      provide them we will then provide them
      with the necessary categories as
      mentioned
      so take for example let's look at
      raffles tower for example so rifles
      tower took around 28 000 cubic meters of
      concrete as such with this amount of
      volume of concrete this will fall under
      the category of medium-sized projects
      with that we will be charging them 63k
      for the 1800 sensors that will be
      supplying them now in 2020 alone
      singapore around 70 plus of such similar
      projects so what this means is that with
      implementation of our solution there is
      an estimated revenue projection of
      around 4.4 million dollars in earnings

      so this is the contraction that we have
      that we have that we have that that we
      are at right now so currently we have
      received interest from three uh from
      three major players in the environment
      sector namely gray form uh soybean as
      well as dsta we have also participated
      and won some competition awards uh one
      in particular is the built environment
      case competition where bca the building
      construction authority had actually
      validated our solution as it strongly
      aligns with this with the construction
      industry transformation map

      so this is the two year action temp plan
      timeline so it comprises of two key
      phases which heavily focuses on r d and
      carrying out trials with our customers
      so as to validate our solution to prove
      our solution and to gain trust with our
      customers the ultimate goal is to
      receive bca's in principle acceptance
      letter which will allow us to
      commercialize our product
      so right now we are currently in working
      with gray form with our trials as seen
      in the photos below

      so this is the team we are a group of
      four engineers we have peter from with
      background in material science
      engineering we have ce we have a
      background in computer engineering and
      we have c we have ting young and i from
      civil engineering

      so going forward we are actively looking
      for 250k in funding for furthering our r
      d and product development we're also
      looking for collaborators for to carry
      out our trials and lastly we're also
      looking for connection incubator
      platforms for investments and
      opportunities
      so with that we are concrete ai and
      we're here to revolutionize the future
      of concrete monitoring thank you`;
