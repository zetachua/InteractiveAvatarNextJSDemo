      `so our company offers three bundling
      packages where we categorize
      the construction projects based on the
      amount of concrete used into small
      medium and large so with that with these
      different bundling packages we will then
      provide them we will then provide them
      with the necessary categories as
      mentioned
      so take for example let's look at
      raffles tower for example so rifles
      tower took around 28 000 cubic meters of
      concrete as such with this amount of
      volume of concrete this will fall under
      the category of medium-sized projects
      with that we will be charging them 63k
      for the 1800 sensors that will be
      supplying them now in 2020 alone
      singapore around 70 plus of such similar
      projects so what this means is that with
      implementation of our solution there is
      an estimated revenue projection of
      around 4.4 million dollars in earnings

      so this is the contraction that we have
      that we have that we have that that we
      are at right now so currently we have
      received interest from three uh from
      three major players in the environment
      sector namely gray form uh soybean as
      well as dsta we have also participated
      and won some competition awards uh one
      in particular is the built environment
      case competition where bca the building
      construction authority had actually
      validated our solution as it strongly
      aligns with this with the construction
      industry transformation map

      so this is the two year action temp plan
      timeline so it comprises of two key
      phases which heavily focuses on r d and
      carrying out trials with our customers
      so as to validate our solution to prove
      our solution and to gain trust with our
      customers the ultimate goal is to
      receive bca's in principle acceptance
      letter which will allow us to
      commercialize our product
      so right now we are currently in working
      with gray form with our trials as seen
      in the photos below

      so this is the team we are a group of
      four engineers we have peter from with
      background in material science
      engineering we have ce we have a
      background in computer engineering and
      we have c we have ting young and i from
      civil engineering

      so going forward we are actively looking
      for 250k in funding for furthering our r
      d and product development we're also
      looking for collaborators for to carry
      out our trials and lastly we're also
      looking for connection incubator
      platforms for investments and
      opportunities
      so with that we are concrete ai and
      we're here to revolutionize the future
      of concrete monitoring thank you`;

Hi! We are Granted, and we are here to solve a problem that a lot of us have: filling up forms.
It’s something we do throughout our lives. Sometimes these forms are short and simple, but other times they can be long, tedious, and dreary. Nevertheless, they’re mandatory, and yet we still have to fill them up with a lot of the same data we use for other forms anyway. It feels like a waste. That’s what my CTO and I thought, based on all our experiences through research projects, public administration, schooling, and just daily life—the bureaucracy of daily life.
So, we introduced to you Granted Forms, your administrative assistant.

How It Works It’s very simple:
You go to a platform and open up a form—it can be on any common platform or file type.
We look at the data on the platform and your past data to prepare the information that needs to go into that form.
With one click, you can apply and fill up all the applicable fields in that form.
We use natural language processing to capture fields that don’t just say the same thing but also mean the same thing.

Why We Stand Out, Sure, there are other people trying to do similar things, and you can always pay someone to do it for you. But before we came along, most of our users were manually copying and pasting or typing from memory. Here’s why we do better:
We save time and clicks for the user.
We offer interface operability and adapt to similarly worded fields, saving users even more time when filling up forms.
That’s what we felt—but is this how the market would feel? That’s what we wanted to find out. So, we decided to try this product out on a specific group: researchers.

Why Researchers?
The need was obvious: almost half their time is spent not doing research, and a majority of that time is spent on administrative work like filling up forms.
We have a slight unfair advantage working with researchers because we’re students—they’re more tempted to work with us rather than ignore us, which is what we found.
Lastly, they are willing and able to pay, unlike some other segments.
Our MVP
With that in mind, we created an MVP for researchers: a Chrome extension that could pass researchers’ data to fill up forms on iGMS, the grant management platform many researchers use. Since this was an MVP, we focused on key functionality: saving time. How could we help them save time quickly and get their forms submitted?

We released this purposefully at the end of the grant cycle to catch those researchers who were likely procrastinating—making the urgency higher and the resistance to uptake even lesser. We gave out brochures and created a landing page to explain the idea.

The Results
We got five researchers to actually use our product and submit their forms.
Beyond that, seven researchers who had already finished form-filling and applications for this cycle committed to using us next time.
What’s even more? We have 100% retention—all our users are actively working with us now to test new features we’re developing in collaboration because they really like the product.
In terms of results, we decreased the time spent per form by 80%, while keeping a high accuracy of more than 90% when filling up these forms.

What’s Next?
Now, with our users, we are building on our core functionality and improving our systems so we can go beyond local researchers (our beachhead market) to a larger, global form-filling market, including consumers like you and me.
We’ll fund our operations through a simple, intuitive freemium model, where you pay for the more advanced features.

A Real Example
If someone was manually filling up a standard form, it could take more than 10 minutes. But with our Granted Chrome extension, they could simply press “Load,” and voilà—in less than 10 seconds, all that data (the same data you saw just now) is filled.
Say Goodbye to Tedious Forms
So, say goodbye to filling out boring, tedious forms and submit your forms instead with Granted.
Thank you!

Hi everyone, I'm Anthia, and I’m excited to introduce Medivha, where we provide virtual reality medical training for students. 
Our mission is to improve patient outcomes by transforming global medical training.

Currently, medical students train with real patients, but this approach has its challenges: it's costly, time-consuming, and the scenarios are limited. 
Additionally, patient actors provide subjective feedback. The problem we solve is the lack of a standardized, realistic, and scalable training platform for medical students.

Medivha offers highly immersive simulations that reduce training time by 75%, provide 7x more patient scenarios, and save medical institutions $7.2 million annually. 
Our VR platform, powered by AI, lets students practice clinical skills like history taking, without needing actual patients. We use hands-tracking technology for physical exams and provide objective feedback to close learning gaps.

Our platform stands out for its high immersion and accessibility. Medivha features high-fidelity animations and AI that closely emulate doctor-patient interactions. 
With the Oculus Quest headset, students can train anywhere, without wires or computers.

The global medical simulation market is worth $355 billion, with a CAGR of 13.7%. 
Medivha's revenue will come from a tiered subscription model.

We're validating our product with the orthopedics department at NUHS and in talks with NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine to expand. 
We’ve also completed requirements with the pediatrics department. Medivha was the only student startup to emerge at the Founder’s Knight pitch competition, and we’ve been featured in Channel News Asia and Business Times.

Our team consists of passionate biomedical engineers who’ve built successful startups, one of which was acquired by Facebook. 
Doctors and medical professionals love working with us, and we believe we can revolutionize medical training. Thank you for listening, and we look forward to seeing you at our booth.

Okay, so can I get a show of hands, who wants to make a decision that they will regret?
Exactly, nobody.
And that's why, since high school, 7 in 10 struggle to choose their majors.
Even when that’s settled, 6 in 10 in university have no concrete plans for what happens after graduation.

Fast forward to the working world, eventually, 80% of us will want to switch careers.
But most of us will be concerned that we don’t have the experience.
Let’s face it, career decisions are difficult because of the sheer amount of uncertainty involved.
The wrong decision could cost you years of youth, happiness, and wealth.
It’s a big problem, a problem worth 16 billion dollars in the USA alone.

Well, how do we solve it?
Hi, I’m Molina, the CEO of Lookup, and our mission is to help people make better career decisions.
Our solution: a web platform to help people generate insights from career paths taken by real people.
We eliminate uncertainty on what people can achieve based on who they are and what the future holds, based on the options they have.

Here are three main ways our users can benefit from our platform:
Firstly, if you have no idea what’s next, we generate a map of career paths taken by people with the same experience and education.
This shows you what’s within your reach.

Secondly, if you already have a target position and company in mind, we help generate a map of experiences that led people to this role.
This lets you see how they ended up there and whether you stand a chance or need to plan ahead.

Lastly, we generate insights based on long-term benefits, like projected income and exit opportunities, to help you make the best decision for your career in the long term.

These are things that cannot be easily achieved with the tools we have today.
That’s why we think we have an edge with our data.
We help people understand what’s within their reach better than job platforms, career quizzes, or career advisors.

LinkedIn has the data, but there’s no way for users to generate these insights easily for themselves.
So why do we have an edge?
We’re building a platform based on a database of more than 150,000 career paths, projected to grow to 5 million by the end of this year.
We’re carefully designing a navigation interface for users to easily find the answers they need.
We’re also building our recommendation algorithm to find people with similar experiences and education, so they can find people to look up to.

With the launch of our MVP just two weeks ago, we tested our platform with 30 users.
Some were career advisors and others from career advisory platforms.
These users had a great experience and want to continue using the platform.
Career advisors are also interested in partnering with us to extend this to their students.
Karishi, a career advisor in China, is interested in extending this to the Chinese market.

We’re following a simple premium model:
For free, users can generate one career map with limited insights.
With our premium model, they can generate unlimited maps and insights.

With this model, we’re looking at a market size of 25 million dollars in Singapore alone, projected to grow to 30 billion worldwide.
Today, we’re asking for 250,000 dollars to grow our product quickly and release our full launch.

So, before I leave you, let me introduce the team:
Myself, Sean, and Shreya.
I’ve built knowledge graphs for large organizations to make sense of messy data.
Sean has worked as a software engineer across three different startups and is ready to start his own.
Shreya has experience doing user research and sales for big names like Intel and Salesforce.

And together, we built Lookup.
We look forward to seeing you at our booth later.
Thank you.
